# Learning Resources

## Introduction

I have found the need to save the resources that are timeless
in a more permanent place than my bookmarks or the many notetaking
apps I tend to use.

I will attempt to keep this list from growing too large by reviewing
it from time to time.

The focus of this list are not what I'm studying right now but
references that I need to go back from time to time or that I'd
like to show to new teammates.
