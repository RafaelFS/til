# Angular Components

Today I learned the concept of a angular component.

https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component

Being away from AngularJS for quite some time, I was not aware of some of the later patterns that emerged.

The tl:dr;  is that Components are a subset of the old directives, which are much closer to the version on Angular(2+) and to how React works.

Nice away to limit the crazy do-whatever-you want that Angular allowed :+1:
